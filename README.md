# GearSwap-Optimizer
An optimizer based off of a custom magic simulator and wsdist. Includes a webui and a lua template reader based on GearSwap Skeleton.


When you downloed the file you'll need to unzip the icons folders for the code to work.

You deploy with "python start_server.py" and it will set up at port 8080 for you. You can change this with commands, so just call --help and it will walk  you through it.

You will also need the addon invdump installed. It's in my account so use it to generate your inventory file and  your job gifts file.

Also, this code is not completed. I'll come back to it evenntually, but right now it's more of an as is thing. The simulator works well but the automated lua template reader still has a bit to be desired. The feeder code, gearswap skeleton is in a similar state. I got it functional for the classes that i play the most. If you want to make changes, please just create a fork. And give it a go. If you think you can have made progress and want to merge your additions, just set up a pull request and we can go over it.
