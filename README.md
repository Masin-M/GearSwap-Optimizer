# GearSwap-Optimizer
An optimizer based off of a custom magic simulator and wsdist. Includes a webui and a lua template reader based on GearSwap Skeleton.

**Requirements**

This program is reliant on two other programs in my repository, invdump and gearswap generator. The optimizer is designed specifically to operate with the inventory and the job gifts file generated by invdump and the lua template tab is designed under the assumption that you used gearswap generator to create your lua file. 

Please see the [Instructions file](/Instructions.md)

**Zipped EXE**

The extracted folder will have several other files and folders in it as well as the EXE. You just run the EXE in this folder. Nothing to install. The server will run until you shut it off. There will be an icon in the System Tray that you can interact with to either open the browser again if you want to run a simulation or you can close the server from that system tray. If you dont' want the page open in a browser, just close it. The server will keep running so you don't have to start the EXE again unless you've shut it down.


**Source Download**

When you download the source you'll need to unzip the icons folders for the code to work if you're planning to run this from a python terminal. If you use the exe, that won't be necessary.

You deploy with "python start_server.py" and it will set up at port 8080 for you. You can change this with commands, so just call --help and it will walk  you through it.

For a full walkthrough of installation requirements and other details please see [README_WEBUI.md](/README_WEBUI.md).


**Disclaimers**

This code is not designed to replace Kastra's wsdist. It is not designed for hyperoptimizers or end game pushers. It's really designed for people who want to use gearswap but dont' want to go through the trouble of setting it up. It's for people that want to get some marginal DPS increases without having to spend hours and hours poring over their gearswap files. That being said, since the inventory parser works as a compatibility between the game and wsdist, you can more easily optimize things like WSs, TP, and Magic with the tab based method where you are selecting your own weapons for each and running simulations one at a time. With that in mind, you should be able to get some decent gear optimizations, though if you truly want the best and most accurate results, Kastra's Wsdist is your best bet.


**Acknowledgments**

I'd like to thank bg-wiki, kastra for ws-dist, and all the people that worked to figure out the equations and quirks of the game. This simulator wouldn't be possible without wsdist as the TP and WS simulations just run a compatability layer and item stat parser that feeds the original wsdist.
